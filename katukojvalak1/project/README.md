# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project implements a Campus Navigation System that models the Montclair State University campus as a weighted graph. The system allows users to:
- View all campus locations
- Find the shortest walking path between two locations
- Identify all reachable locations from a given starting point
- Compare BFS and Dijkstra’s algorithm

Graph algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm are implemented using Python.

# HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed
2. Download the project files
3. Open a terminal in the project directory
4. Run the program using:
   ```bash
   python campus_navigation.py
5. Follow on screen menu instructions

# FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

1. Campus modeled as a weighted graph
2. BFS for reachability analysis
3. Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest path computation
4. Menu-driven user interface
5. Algorithm comparison (BFS vs Dijkstra)
6. Real-world campus reference with estimated distances

# REQUIREMENTS

1. Python 3.x
2. No external libraries required (uses standard Python libraries)

# EXAMPLE

Start Location: Freeman Hall
Destination: CCIS
Output: Shortest path, total distance, and nodes explored
