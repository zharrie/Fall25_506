Description
Assuming an already made CSV of initial participants in a study, this tool filters through them for people who meet the requirements to be included. It also creates a new subset of people who checked off that they wanted to be included in a future section of the study. Through that subset of people, annotators are allocated to files gathered in the first part of the study.

Objectives
- Filter for certain attributes
- Use graphs for checking which participants know each other
