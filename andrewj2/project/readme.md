# [CSIT506 Fall '25] Final Project - Social Network Analyzer

Author: Jasper Andrew

## to-do
- ~~load network~~
- connection analysis
   - find degree of separation between any two users
   - find mutual friends between two users
   - ~~find all friends within N degrees~~
- ~~network statistics~~
  - ~~most connected users (by number of friends)~~
  - ~~average connections per user~~
  - ~~network diameter (longest shortest path)~~
- ~~most/least connected users~~
- friend suggestions
   - find connection path
   - suggest new friends (friends-of-friends not already connected)
   - rank suggestions by mutual friends
- ~~user search~~
- readme
   - project title and your name
   - brief description of what your project does
   - how to run your program (step-by-step instructions)
   - list of features implemented
   - any dependencies or installation requirements
   - sample usage/screenshots (optional but encouraged)
   - complexity analysis
      - data structures used: explain which ones you used and why you chose them
      - time complexity analysis: big-o notation for all major operations
      - space complexity analysis: memory usage for key data structures
      - algorithm comparison: compare at least 2 different approaches for a key operation
      - trade-offs: discuss design decisions and why you made them
